    <p> <strong>Robert John Downey Jr.</strong> (born April 4, 1965) <sup> <a href="#">[2]</a></sup> is an American
        actor
        and singer. His
        career has
        included critical
        and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal difficulties, and a
        resurgence of commercial success in middle age. For three consecutive years from 2012 to 2015,
        Downey topped the<a href="#"> Forbes</a> list of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, making an estimated $80
        million in earnings
        between June 2014 and June 2015.<sup><a href="#">[3]</a><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Making his acting debut at the age of five, appearing in <a href="#">his father</a>'s film <a
            href="#"><em>Pound</em></a> (1970), Downey appeared in
        roles associated with the<a href="#"> Brat Pack</a>, such as the teen sci-fi comedy<a href="#"><em> Weird
                Science</em></a></a> (1985) and the drama <a href="#"><em>Less Than
                Zero</em></a> (1987). He starred as the <a href="#"> title character</a> in the 1992 film <a
            href="#">Chaplin</a>, for which he earned a nomination for
        the<a href="#"> Academy Award for Best Actor</a> and he won the<a href="#"> BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a
            Leading Role</a>. After being
        released in 2000 from the <a href="#">California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison</a> where
        he was
        incarcerated on drug charges, Downey joined the cast of the TV series <a href="#"><em>Ally McBeal</em></a>
        playing <a href="#">Calista Flockhart's</a>
        love interest. For that he earned a<a href="#"> Golden Globe Award</a>. His character was terminated when Downey
        was fired after
        two drug arrests in late 2000 and early 2001. After his last stay in a court-ordered drug treatment program,
        Downey achieved sobriety.
    </p>
    <P>
        Downey's career prospects improved when he featured in the black comedy crime <a href="#"> Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
        </a>(2005), the
        mystery thriller<a href="#"> Zodiac</a> (2007), and the satirical action comedy<a href="#"> Tropic Thunder</a>
        (2008); for the latter he was
        nominated for an <a href="#">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>. Beginning in 2008, Downey began
        portraying the role of
        <a href="#"> Marvel Comics</a> superhero<a href="#"> Iron Man</a> in the<a href="#"> Marvel Cinematic
            Universe</a>, appearing in several films as either the lead
        role, member of an ensemble cast, or in a <a href="#"> cameo</a>. Each of these films, with the exception of <a
            href="#">The Incredible Hulk</a>,
        has grossed over $500 million at the box office worldwide; four of these—<a href="#"> The Avengers</a>,<a
            href="#"> Avengers: Age of Ultron</a>,
        <a href="#">Iron Man 3</a> and<a href="#">Captain America: Civil War</a>—earned over $1 billion, while <a
            href="#">Avengers: Infinity War</a> earned over $2
        billion.
    </P>
    <p>
        Downey has also played the<a href="#"> title character</a> in<a href="#"> Guy Ritchie</a>'s <a href="#">Sherlock
            Holmes</a> (2009), which earned him his second
        Golden Globe win, and<a href="#"> its sequel</a> (2011), both of which have earned over $500 million at the box
        office
        worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of 2018, the U.S. domestic box-office grosses of Downey's films total over US $4.9 billion, with worldwide
        grosses surpassing $11.6 billion, making Downey the third highest-grossing U.S. domestic box-office star of all
        time.<sup>[5]</sup>

    <p>Downey started dating actress<a href="#"> Sarah Jessica Parker</a> after meeting her on the set of <a
            href="#"><i>Firstborn</i></a>. The couple later
        separated due to his drug addiction.<sup>[<a href="#">118</a>]</sup></p>
    <p>He married actress/singer <a href="#">Deborah Falconer</a> on May 29, 1992, after a 42-day courtship.<sup>[<a
                href="#">119</a>]</sup> Their son,
        Indio
        Falconer Downey, was born in September 1993.<sup>[<a href="#">120</a>]</sup> The strain on their marriage from
        Downey's repeated
        trips to
        rehab and jail finally reached a breaking point; in 2001, in the midst of Downey's last arrest and sentencing to
        an extended stay in rehab, Falconer left Downey and took their son with her.<sup>[118]</sup> Downey and Falconer
        finalized
        their divorce on April 26, 2004.</p>
    <p>In 2003, Downey met producer <a href="#"> Susan Levin</a>, an Executive Vice President of Production at <a
            href="#">Joel Silver</a>'s film
        company, <a href="#">Silver Pictures</a> on the set of <a href="#">Gothika</a>.<sup>[<a
                href="#">64</a>]</sup>sup Downey and Susan quietly struck up a romance
        during
        production, though Susan turned down his romantic advances twice.<sup>[<a href="#">121</a>]</sup> Despite
        Susan's worries that
        the romance
        would not last after the completion of shooting because "he's an actor; I have a real job",<sup>[<a
                href="#">121</a>]</sup> the
        couple's
        relationship continued after production wrapped on Gothika, and Downey proposed to Susan on the night before her
        thirtieth birthday.<sup>[<a href="#">121</a>]</sup> The couple were married in August 2005, in a Jewish ceremony
        at <a href="#">Amagansett</a>,
        <a href="#">New York</a>.<sup>[<a href="#">122</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#">123</a>]</sup> A tattoo on one of his
        biceps reads "Suzie Q" in tribute to
        her.<sup>[<a href="#">124</a>]</sup> Their first child, a son,
        was born in February 2012,<sup>[<a href="#">125</a>]</sup> their second child, a daughter, was born in November
        2014.<sup>[<a href="#">126</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#">127</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#">128</a>]</sup></p>
    <p>Downey has been a close friend of <a href="#">Mel Gibson</a> since they starred in Air America. Downey defended
        Gibson during the
        controversy surrounding<a href="#"><i> The Passion of the Christ</i></a>, and said "nobody's perfect" in
        reference to<a href="#"> Gibson's
            DUI</a>.<sup>[<a href="#">129</a>]</sup> Gibson said of Downey: "He was one of the first people to call and
        offer the hand of
        friendship. He
        just said, 'Hey, welcome to the club. Let's go see what we can do to work on ourselves.'"<sup>[<a
                href="#">130</a>]</sup> In
        October 2011,
        Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his
        award for his life's work, and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose
        him to present the award.<sup>[<a href="#">131</a>]</sup></p>
